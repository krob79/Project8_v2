# Project8_v2

Called "v2" because this is a re-do of Project 8 from complete scratch without even looking at the old project for reference.

This is a SQL Library Manager, where you can create, update, and delete books. For a little razzle dazzle, I've added some scripts in the pug files for extra form validation and a little CSS animation for status updates.
